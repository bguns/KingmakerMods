    // This patch is used to set the Main.Library reference. It has a priority of First. This allows other additions to the 
    // blueprint library to use their own patches, referring to Main.Library, and avoids necessitating all library patches
    // to be somehow grouped in one huge patch method.
    //
    // IMPORTANT: LoadDictionary will possibly be run multiple times. m_Initialized will be true subsequent runs, which will
    //  cause the method to return instantly, however, ANY POSTFIX METHODS WILL STILL RUN, and possibly add multiple copies
    //  of the same feature/component etc...
    //
    // Given the above observation, I don't really think that the strategy as described in the first paragraph is all that
    // reliable, and will just use __instance in all LoadDictionary postfixes. I'm leaving this active just in case, it
    // does almost nothing.
